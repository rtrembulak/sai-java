// 2. Create an interface, that has methods:
//     a) getSquare - takes in an integer as a parameter and returns the square of that number.
//     b) getSquareRoot - takes in an integer as a paramter and returns the square root of that number.
//     c) largestInteger - takes in two integers as a parameters, compares the two integers and returns the largest of the two.
// 3. Implement the interface in step 2 using a class "MathOperations".
// 4. Use the interface and perform the operations in a "Main.java" class.
